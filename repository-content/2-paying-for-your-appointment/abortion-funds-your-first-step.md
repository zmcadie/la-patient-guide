## Abortion funds - your first step
Once you have your appointment scheduled, you will probably be asked to contact the National Abortion Federation (NAF) Hotline and/or your local abortion fund.
You can find the NAF hotline here: 
NAF Hotline: https://prochoice.org/patients/naf-hotline/
FYI NAF will ask for “qualifying information” to determine your level of need. They use the information that you five them to determine how much funding they can contribute to your care. They will ask questions like “how much you have in savings” or “whether you receive child support payments”. They will not ask for any proof or backup for the answers you give them. Our advice is to tell them that you have nothing.
The National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF): https://abortionfunds.org/need-abortion/ 
This is a collection of independent groups in states all across the country who exist to help people get abortions.
